# Hammer Build Tool

A template repo that you can use to compile all dependencies for our free open source tools.

## Overview
Most tools created by Poly Hammer are open source, however, some do have dependencies on other libraries or software's code that have restrictive licenses requiring you to compile those dependencies for your own productions. This build tool can be purchased as a convenience to help you or your company build the dependencies for yourself. However, the user/company is solely responsible for ensuring that they are not violating any software licensing by using this tool.

If you are technical, please feel free to download our free open source tools and compile the dependencies for yourself. However, we can't provide any technical support or guidance due to time constraints. If you find our tools beneficial, please consider supporting our continued efforts to develop free open source tools by purchasing this build tool. Thank you.
